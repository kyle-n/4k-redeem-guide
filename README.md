# 4K Redeem Guide

A simple React Native app to help you figure out where to redeem your 4K UHD Blu-ray digital code. Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/4k-4-u/id1499701546) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kylenazario.fourK4U&hl=en_US&gl=US).

## Background

Cinephiles maintain an amazing [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsJkCX4DIv2oeCKQ7zp2ArkR1qKEXCUuCMBbUtHtmh4/htmlview#) of 4K DVD releases explaining which ones redeem where and and in what quality. It is a vital resource for navigating the mess studios leave us. 

However, it is not especially mobile-friendly. My app provides a simple wrapper for the spreadsheet for quick access on your phone.
