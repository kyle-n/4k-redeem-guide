No more guessing where to redeem the digital code that came with your 4K UHD DVD. 

**4K 4 U** tells you where to redeem your digital code to get a 4K copy, what titles are on Movies Anywhere and which ones stream in HDR with Dolby Vision. No more trying to guess whether to redeem your 4K digital code on Vudu or iTunes!

**Features**

- **Search by barcode**: Scan the DVD's barcode and **4K 4 U** will find the title
- **Light/dark mode**: Uses Android's system-wide dark mode to toggle between beautiful light and dark themes.
- **Special tablet layout**: Not just a stretched-out phone app! **4K 4 U** takes advantage of the form factor to display a denser interface with more information.
- **Always current**: **4K 4 U** is powered by a community-maintained [spreadsheet](1) of 4K releases, so it's always up-to-date. 
- **Free!** If **4K 4 U** is a big hit, I will consider adding new (paid) features, but for now this is a simple, mobile-friendly wrapper for the 4K release spreadsheet.
